JDK, JRE and JVM
=================
JDK, JRE, and JVM are three core components of the Java 
ecosystem, each with distinct roles. 
-	The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software 
	development kit used for creating Java applications. 
	JDK ----> CREATE JAVA APPS.
	
-	The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the 
	environment for running Java applications.
	JRE ----> RUN JAVA APPS
	
-	The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the engine that 
	executes Java bytecode, enabling platform independence. 
	JVM ----> EXECUTES BYTECODE
	

JDK (Java Development Kit):
It's a kit for Java developers, providing tools like 
compilers, debuggers, and documentation generators. 
It includes the JRE, so when you install the JDK, you also 
get the environment to run Java programs. 
Essentially, it's what you need to develop Java code. 

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): 
It provides the runtime environment for Java applications, including the JVM and necessary libraries. 
It's what you need to run Java applications, 
but not to develop them. 
It's platform-dependent, meaning you need a JRE specific 
to your operating system. 

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
It's the core of the Java runtime environment, responsible for executing Java bytecode. 
It provides platform independence by abstracting away the 
underlying hardware and operating system. 
JVM - java abc(bytecode)
==========================================================
It interprets bytecode into machine-specific instructions,
allowing Java code to run on different platforms. 
===========================================================
It's a key component of the JRE.
