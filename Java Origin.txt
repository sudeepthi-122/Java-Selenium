Java
====
-	Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming 
	language. 
	
-	This language is very easy to learn and widely used. 
	
-	It is known for its platform independence,reliability 
	and security. It follows one principle, that is:
	"Write Once, Run Anywhere"(WORA) principle.

Java's origin
-------------

-	Java's history begins in 1991 at Sun Microsystems, 
	where a team led by "James Gosling" aimed to create a 
	new programming language for digital devices. 

-	Initially called Oak, it was later renamed Java, 
	inspired by Indonesian coffee beans. 
	
-	The language's core principle of "Write Once, 
	Run Anywhere" (platform independence) fueled its 
	rapid adoption, especially with the rise of the 
	internet. 
	

Java Versions
==============
1991-1994: The Green Project and Oak. Sun Microsystems' 
"Green Team" (including Gosling, Mike Sheridan, 
and Patrick Naughton) initiated the project to develop 
a language for embedded systems, focusing on consumer 
electronics. The initial language was called Oak, 
named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office. 

1995: Java's Public Debut. 
Sun Microsystems officially 
launched Java, emphasizing its platform-independent 
nature. The "HotJava" browser was introduced to showcase 
Java applets. 

1996: First Version (1.0). The initial version of Java, 1.0,
was released. 

1997: Standardization. 
Java was standardized by ISO and ANSI, solidifying its 
position as a reliable language. 

1999: Java 2 Platform (J2SE, J2EE, J2ME). Java was divided 
into three editions to cater to different needs. 

2004: Java 5 and Enhancements. Java 5 introduced significant 
language enhancements, including generics and other 
features. 

2006: Open Sourcing. 
Sun Microsystems made Java open source by releasing 
the OpenJDK. 

2010: Oracle Acquisition. 
Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems,taking over Java's 
development and future. 

2014: Java 8 and Modern Features. 
Java 8 brought in features like lambda expressions and a new Date and Time 
API. 

2017: Java 9 and Modularization. 
Java 9 introduced the 
module system (JPMS) for modularizing applications. 

Continued Evolution: Java continues to evolve with regular 
releases, incorporating new features and improvements.
