PATH and CLASSPATH
==================
-	The CLASSPATH specifies where the JVM looks for .class 
	files.
-	PATH (a separate environment variable) specifies 
	where the operating system looks for executable 
	programs (like java and javac).

-	Using the -classpath option is generally preferred 
	over modifying the environment variable for better 
	isolation and project-specific control.
