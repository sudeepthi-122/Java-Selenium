Data types in java
===================
Java categorizes data types into two main groups: 
Primitive data types and non-primitive(or reference)data 
types.

==============================================================
NOTE: We cannot create the OBJECT of any PRIMITIVE data type.
===============================================================
Due to the presence of PRIMITIVE data types, 
JAVA is not "TRUE" ObjectOrientedLanguage.

Primitive Data Types:
---------------------
These are fundamental data types that directly store values and are predefined in Java. There are eight primitive data types:

Integral Types:
---------------
1.	byte: 8-bit signed integer(1 byte) (-128 to 127).
2.	short: 16-bit signed integer(2 bytes) (-32,768 to 32,767).
3.	int: 32-bit signed integer(4 bytes) (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647). This is the default integer type.
4.	long: 64-bit signed integer(8 bytes) (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Used for very large integer values.

Floating-Point Types:
---------------------
1.	float: 32-bit(4 bytes) single-precision floating-point number.
2.	double: 64-bit(8 bytes) double-precision floating-point number. This is the default floating-point type.

Character Type:
---------------
1.	char: 16-bit(2 bytes) Unicode character (stores a single character).

Boolean Type:
-------------
1.	boolean: Stores true or false values.

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
=====================================
These data types do not store the actual values directly 
but rather store references (memory addresses) to objects. They are created by the programmer and include:
1.	Classes: User-defined blueprints for creating objects.

2.	Interfaces: Blueprints of a class that define methods 
	but do not implement them.

3.	Arrays: Collections of elements of the same data type.
4.	Strings: A sequence of characters (a special class in 
	Java).
